This file is best read with Typora - http://typora.io

Website was done with HTML 4, CSS 3, Bootstrap 4, jQuery, and PHP.

Adopted Modular CSS for naming conventions.

Used Git and GitHub for version control and file management - Url to fork - https://github.com/Amber-Williams/NSCom.git

There is one home page header and footer, then deep page header and footers that are called per each corrisponding index page.

IMPORTANT NOTES:
The QRcodes and linkReader files are used for our printing technology to forward to certain pages on the website. Should you need to change the PHP to change is in header of each index.php file.

There was some issues with jQuery so some JS scripts are on several index.php files, if you move they will break unless you debug the jQuery version issues. 

==For the white rx rebrand==

- Drag files in whiteRX-workingFiles outside and overwrite current files in its place (unless changes were made to any web files between 12/17/18 and current)
