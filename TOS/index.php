			This Privacy Policy and Terms of Use apply to the website maintained by Nerium Skincare, Inc. (“Nerium Skincare” or “we” or “us”) for its professional healthcare customers and distributors (the “Website”). By accessing and using this Website, each User (“you” or “User”) agrees to be bound by this Privacy Policy and Terms of Use (“Terms”). If you do not agree with any provision, please exit the Website and do not use any services we offer on or through the Website (“Services”).
			<br/>
			YOU ACCEPT THESE TERMS AND PRIVACY POLICY BY CONTINUING TO USE THE WEBSITE OR BY REGISTERING WITH US ON A WEBSITE (IF REGISTRATION IS OFFERED).  IF YOU DO NOT AGREE, DO NOT USE THIS WEBSITE OR ANY SERVICES WE PROVIDE ON OR THROUGH THIS WEBSITE.</p>

			<h2>A. NERIUM SKINCARE PRIVACY POLICY</h2>
			<p>Nerium Skincare respects your privacy. We collect and use your personal information solely for purposes of your use of this Website and in connection with any transaction you initiate.</p>

			<h2>1. Collection and Use of Personally Identifiable Information</h2>
			<p>Nerium Skincare collects only personally identifiable information (PII) that you voluntarily submit to us through this Website or through other communications, or which we obtain in order to provide certain services to you, or to complete transactions you request.  PII is information that identifies a specific User (such as name, address, contact information, employment information), or a User’s financial information (such as credit card information, bank account information, and information about the date, amount and nature of financial transactions). Information relating to Website usage patterns of the User (such as history of site usage, member ID, IP address, user name, session ID, or information regarding web pages the User views through the use of such technology as cookies, log files, clear gifs, and other advanced software technologies) is not considered PII unless it is linked to other personally identifying information. General demographic data that does not identify an individual or data that has been made anonymous is not considered PII.
			<br/>
			We obtain PII from you when you do any of the following: order products from us, register with us, enter a Nerium Skincare promotion, submit comments to us, ask us for information, subscribe to receive emails or other notices from us, or otherwise submit PII to us.  Specifically, we may collect the following personal information: your name, email address, telephone numbers, and other demographic information (like zip code, age, address). If you make a purchase through our website, we may also collect account information relating to your method of payment.
			<br/>
			We use the PII we collect to process your orders and other requests or to send you information or material for which you asked or which we think you will enjoy. We also use the PII to assess and improve our products and services. We give access to certain PII data to companies helping us with technical or operational issues, on a need-to-know basis, subject to confidentiality protections. We may share PII information with our affiliated companies. We will not share any personal credit card or other financial information with any third party, except as necessary to facilitate or process a financial transaction or comply with a legal obligation. We reserve the right to provide any successor in interest with our customer and user databases and lists, and to comply with court orders or other legal obligations.  We may share your name, email address, physical address and other demographic information with affiliates which may contact you for business purposes.

			While we strive to protect your personal information from unauthorized access, please remember that no data transmission over the Internet can be guaranteed to be 100% secure. We cannot ensure or warrant the security of any information you transmit to us over the Internet. Also, please note that e-mail is not encrypted and is not considered a secure means of transmitting credit card numbers.</p>

			<h2>2. Collection of Other Data</h2>
			<p>We may collect the IP address of our visitors and use that data to gather broad demographic information about them. We also may use cookies to enhance your experience with our website. “Cookies" are small files downloaded to your hard drive that enable your browser to save and recall information. We may use this data to tailor our visitors’ experiences, showing them content that we think they might be interested in, and displaying the content according to their preferences. We may share demographic information with our distributors, vendors and advertising channel members on an aggregate basis.
			<br/>
			We may also use “log files” to analyze the usage of our website. These files collect such data as Internet protocol (IP) addresses, browser type, Internet service provider (ISP), referring/exit pages, platform type, date/time stamp, and number of clicks of users. We use this data to review usage, administer our website, track a user’s overall movement and collect broad demographic information for aggregate use.  IP addresses, etc. are not linked to personally identifiable information.
			<br/>
			We also may use advanced software technology (sometimes called clear gifs, Web Beacons or Web Bugs) to help us manage content on our site. These mechanisms use small graphics with unique identifiers and enable us to analyze traffic and website movements. They do not reveal or convey PII. We also track User’s review of and responses to advertising, including emails and website advertising. We may also collect and use information about your online visit to our or other websites, or your online browsing, to increase our ability to provide you with information about products or services that we believe will be of interest to us.</p>

			<h2>3. Security</h2>
			<p>Nerium Skincare takes precautions to protect the security of your personal information and to ensure that your choices for its intended use are honored. These precautions help protect your data from loss, misuse, unauthorized access or disclosure, alteration, or destruction. However, we cannot guarantee the total security of that PII, or that we will be immune from hacking incidents or security breaches.</p>

			<h2>4. Edits/Opt-Out Options</h2>
			<p>Nerium Skincare gives users the option to edit or update the personal information already given us and/or to unsubscribe from any email or mail lists.

If you receive notices from other entities, you will need to contact them if you have any questions or want to change your information or preferences with them.</p>
