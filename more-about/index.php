Our natural products are founded on the result of years of continuing research at leading medical institu- tions, using the latest scientific methods and technology. Utilizing biotechnology research and new breakthrough extraction technology, Nerium SkinCare has formulated and developed a complete line of products that harnesses the unique and ef- fective properties of the Nerium oleander plant.<br/>

        Our vision is to consistently bring “first-in-class” products to market based on our firm belief in three tenets:<br/>

          <h1>History</h1>
          <p>We observed skin healing properties when researching the Nerium oleander plant in our labs. The history of Nerium SkinCare begins with groundbreaking research conducted by Dr. Robert Newman during his time with our parent company, Nerium Biotechnology. Dr. Newman’s research with natural botanical compounds led to the re-discovery, identification, isolation, and further development of core ingredients from the Nerium oleander plant. Continuing research and utilization of proprietary technologies has provided us the opportunity to develop a series of prod- ucts that you know today as the NeriumAD® line of skin care.<br/>
          Historical use of the Nerium oleander plant has been re- ported in ancient texts and folklore for more than 1,500 years. In fact, the Nerium oleander plant has been used traditionally as folk remedies for a wide variety of condi- tions. Over the last decade, there has been a considerable increase in the number of peer-reviewed studies in science journals that substantiate the properties of the Nerium ole- ander plant and its benefits.</p>

          <h1>Quality</h1>
          <p>As a commitment to quality, Nerium SkinCare does not compromise on what goes into our products. The quality of Nerium Skincare's products is a direct result of the in- vestment into the people, scientific research, new tech- nology development, natural farming methods, biomass processing, cGMP production facilities, and product safety testing.<br/>

          The Nerium FarmsTM is the largest Nerium oleander op- eration of its kind in the world. Using environmentally re- sponsible and sustainable techniques, these naturally grown Nerium oleander plants, provide the raw material that make Nerium SkinCare’s products revolutionary. Abiding by strict protocols, the Nerium oleander farm provides a dedicated and renewable biomass resource that is reserved exclusively for Nerium SkinCare.</p>

        <div class="col-md-6">
          <p>Considering that there were no historical accounts of Nerium oleander farming, it was imperative for Nerium SkinCare to de- velop our own farming operations in order to broaden and commercialize access to the plant. Initially, transitioning of the plant from the nursery environment into a commercial environ- ment involved the establishment of a research entity that al- lowed scientists to understand the growth patterns properly. Over time, as the physiology of Nerium oleander became more evident, planting and irrigation techniques, along with harvest- ing and planting equipment, had to be newly developed. Nerium SkinCare is proud to say that we built our current farm- ing operations from the ground up. <br/>

          After a decade of experience in Nerium oleander commercial farming, Nerium SkinCare continues to focus on new technolo- gy and research that will allow us to enhance our farming oper- ations. We are very proud of our all natural approach and ad- herence to strict biomedical field protocols. We continually seek ways to increase land utilization and field plant capacity through the development of improved planting and irrigations</p>
